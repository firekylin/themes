# Butterfly for Firekylin

Blue hero, alternating image/text cards and a profile sidebar.

Adapted from [wehaox/Typecho-Butterfly](https://github.com/wehaox/Typecho-Butterfly) at `bb5fb5922a4b2d74a7829005a2a507027fe08ffa`.

## Install

Copy this directory into `themes/butterfly` (independent project) or
`www/theme/butterfly` (legacy/core installation), then select it in Appearance.
Requires Firekylin >=2.16.0 with Eta/Widgets; verified against core `99bbdcb`.
No PHP, npm install or compilation is required at runtime. A small local script builds the article table of contents.

## Supported

Home and category/tag/author lists; post, page and attachment detail; search and
query-preserving pagination; archives; category/tag directories; empty states;
404/500; configured site navigation; RSS; public recent-post sidebar where shown;
featuredImage where the layout has covers; core-rendered body/password forms;
native comments through `firekylin.comment()`, respecting core disabled/login rules.
Only public Widgets supply data; templates issue no database queries.

Appearance settings: plain-text footer and introduction, validated hex accent
color, `colorMode=dark` for dark colors, and a sidebar heading.
Missing covers use local CSS gradients, never unlicensed upstream photographs.
Navigation stays available without JavaScript. Mobile layouts collapse sidebars.

## Differences from Typecho

This is a first Firekylin adaptation of the reading layout, not a PHP compatibility
layer. Unsupported upstream features: PJAX, local search index, animated effects, photo galleries, reading mode, automatic table of contents and Typecho-specific plugins.
Search uses Firekylin `keyword`; comments use native Waline instead of Typecho
comment forms. No analytics, paid feature, external update request, advertising
or credential-dependent integration is enabled by the theme.

## Verify

`pnpm test` renders all eight page types with populated/empty fixtures and checks
pagination, escaping, settings and resources. `pnpm test:browser` exercises desktop
and mobile HTTP previews and writes screenshots. Use `CHROMIUM_PATH` for a local
Chromium or run `pnpm exec playwright-core install chromium` first.
`FIREKYLIN_CORE_PATH=/path/to/firekylin node --test test/ports.test.js` uses actual
core Widget classes and comment rendering. These are real Eta/Chromium renders
with synthetic data, not a live database installation; posting to a remote comment
service or authenticating a real user is not part of this check.


Settings include `headerimg`, `mobileHeaderImg`, `avatar` and `followUrl`. See [VISUAL-COMPARISON.md](VISUAL-COMPARISON.md) for comparison evidence and limitations.
